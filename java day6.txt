Using Multiple Classes
Like we specified in the Classes chapter, it is a good practice to create an object of a class and access it in another class.

Remember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this example, we have created two files in the same directory:

Main.java
Second.java
Main.java

public class Main {
  public void fullThrottle() {
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }

  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
  }
}
Second.java

class Second {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myCar = new Main();     // Create a myCar object
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method
  }
}
When both files have been compiled:

C:\Users\Your Name>javac Main.java
C:\Users\Your Name>javac Second.java
Run the Second.java file:

C:\Users\Your Name>java Second
