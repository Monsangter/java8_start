Public class main {
	static void mymethod() {
	  System.out.println("I just got executed!");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  myMethod();
	}A method can also be called multiple times:

Example
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
  }
}

// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!

Create a Method
A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:

Parameters and Arguments
Information can be passed to methods as parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the method.

Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.

The following example has a method that takes a String called fname as parameter. When the method is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the method to print the full name:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod(String fname) {
    System.out.println(fname + " Refsnes");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod("Liam");
    myMethod("Jenny");
    myMethod("Anja");
  }
}
// Liam Refsnes
// Jenny Refsnes
// Anja Refsnes

When a parameter is passed to the method, it is called an argument. So, from the example above: fname is a parameter, while Liam, Jenny and Anja are arguments.

Multiple Parameters
You can have as many parameters as you like:

When a parameter is passed to the method, it is called an argument. So, from the example above: fname is a parameter, while Liam, Jenny and Anja are argument

Note that when you are working with multiple parameters, the method call must have the same number of arguments as there are parameters, and the arguments must be passed in the same order.

Return Values
The void keyword, used in the examples above, indicates that the method should not return a value. If you want the method to return a value, you can use a primitive data type (such as int, char, etc.) instead of void, and use the return keyword inside the method:

public class Main {
  static int myMethod(int x) {
    return 5 + x;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(myMethod(3));
  }
}
// Outputs 8 (5 + 3)

public class Main {
  static int myMethod(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(myMethod(5, 3));
  }
}
// Outputs 8 (5 + 3)

You can also store the result in a variable (recommended, as it is easier to read and maintain):

Example
public class Main {
  static int myMethod(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int z = myMethod(5, 3);
    System.out.println(z);
  }
}
// Outputs 8 (5 + 3)

public class Main {
  static int myMethod(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int z = myMethod(5, 3);
    System.out.println(z);
  }
}
// Outputs 8 (5 + 3)

Java Method Overloading

Method Overloading
With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters:

Example
int myMethod(int x)
float myMethod(float x)
double myMethod(double x, double y)
Consider the following example, which has two methods that add numbers of different type:

Example
static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  int myNum1 = plusMethodInt(8, 5);
  double myNum2 = plusMethodDouble(4.3, 6.26);
  System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);
  System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);
}

Method Overloading

double myMethod(double x, double y)

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {

}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  int myNum1 = plusMethodInt(8, 5);
  double myNum2 = plusMethodDouble(4.3, 6.26);
  System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);
  System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);
}

Instead of defining two methods that should do the same thing, it is better to overload one.

In the example below, we overload the plusMethod method to work for both int and double:

Example
static int plusMethod(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

static double plusMethod(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  int myNum1 = plusMethod(8, 5);
  double myNum2 = plusMethod(4.3, 6.26);
  System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);
  System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);
}

Note: Multiple methods can have the same name as long as the number and/or type of parameters are different.


Method Scope
Variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method following the line of code in which they were declared:

Example
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Code here CANNOT use x

    int x = 100;

    // Code here can use x
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}

Block Scope
A block of code refers to all of the code between curly braces {}.

Variables declared inside blocks of code are only accessible by the code between the curly braces, which follows the line in which the variable was declared:

Example
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Code here CANNOT use x

    { // This is a block

      // Code here CANNOT use x

      int x = 100;

      // Code here CAN use x
      System.out.println(x);

   } // The block ends here

  // Code here CANNOT use x

  }
}
A block of code may exist on its own or it can belong to an if, while or for statement. In the case of for statements, variables declared in the statement itself are also available inside the block's scope.


Java Recursion
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.
