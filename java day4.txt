The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.Java - What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

You will learn much more about classes and objects in the next chapter.Java Classes/Objects
Java is an object-oriented programming language.

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

Create a Class
To create a class, use the keyword class:

Main.java
Create a class named "Main" with a variable x:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}
Remember from the Java Syntax chapter that a class should always start with an uppercase first letter, and that the name of the java file should match the class name.

Create an Object
In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named Main, so now we can use this to create objects.

To create an object of Main, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

Multiple Objects
You can create multiple objects of one class:

Example
Create two objects of Main:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj1 = new Main();  // Object 1
    Main myObj2 = new Main();  // Object 2
    System.out.println(myObj1.x);
    System.out.println(myObj2.x);
  }
}

Using Multiple Classes
You can also create an object of a class and access it in another class. This is often used for better organization of classes (one class has all the attributes and methods, while the other class holds the main() method (code to be executed)).

Remember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this example, we have created two files in the same directory/folder:

Main.java
Second.java
Main.java

public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}
Second.java

class Second {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
When both files have been compiled:

C:\Users\Your Name>javac Main.java
C:\Users\Your Name>javac Second.java
Run the Second.java file:

C:\Users\Your Name>java Second
And the output will be:

Java Class Attributes
❮ PreviousNext ❯
Java Class Attributes
In the previous chapter, we used the term "variable" for x in the example (as shown below). It is actually an attribute of the class. Or you could say that class attributes are variables within a class:

Example
Create a class called "Main" with two attributes: x and y:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 3;
}
Another term for class attributes is fields.

Accessing Attributes
You can access attributes by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot syntax (.):

The following example will create an object of the Main class, with the name myObj. We use the x attribute on the object to print its value:

Example
Create an object called "myObj" and print the value of x:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

Modify Attributes
You can also modify attribute values:

Example
Set the value of x to 40:

public class Main {
  int x;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    myObj.x = 40;
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

Or override existing values:

Example
Change the value of x to 25:

public class Main {
  int x = 10;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    myObj.x = 25; // x is now 25
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

If you don't want the ability to override existing values, declare the attribute as final:

Example
public class Main {
  final int x = 10;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    myObj.x = 25; // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
 
Try it Yourself »

The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).

The final keyword is called a "modifier". You will learn more about these in the Java Modifiers Chapter.

Multiple Objects
If you create multiple objects of one class, you can change the attribute values in one object, without affecting the attribute values in the other:

Example
Change the value of x to 25 in myObj2, and leave x in myObj1 unchanged:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj1 = new Main();  // Object 1
    Main myObj2 = new Main();  // Object 2
    myObj2.x = 25;
    System.out.println(myObj1.x);  // Outputs 5
    System.out.println(myObj2.x);  // Outputs 25
  }
}

Multiple Attributes
You can specify as many attributes as you want:

Example
public class Main {
  String fname = "John";
  String lname = "Doe";
  int age = 24;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.fname + " " + myObj.lname);
    System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.age);
  }
}
